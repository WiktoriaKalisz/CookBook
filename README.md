# CookBook

CookBook is a recipe web application, featuring a responsive layout. It's built with Next.js, Sanity CMS, custom React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript components.
It allows users to browse recipes, filter by category, search by name, view detailed recipe instructions, adjust servings, and see dietary indicators like vegan, vegetarian, or spicy. The app supports a light/dark theme powered by ThemeProvider for a dynamic visual experience.

## UX Principles Applied

The design of CookBook incorporates few key UX principles to create an intuitive and user-friendly experience:

- **Aesthetic-Usability Effect**  
Stylized dish images on plates, along with consistent typography and color schemes, make the app feel more aesthetically pleasing and more usable.

- **Law of Similarity**  
Dietary icons (vegan, vegetarian, spicy) share a consistent visual style, allowing users to recognize and understand them quickly.

- **Chunking**  
On the recipe list page, all recipes are displayed in uniform cards. This groups each recipe into a distinct, digestible unit, making it easier for users to scan and process multiple items at once.

- **Law of Proximity**  
Related elements (e.g., ingredient amounts and serving adjustment buttons) are grouped closely together, making it easier to understand their relationships.
